# 🚗 Flexibility Potential of Residential EV Charging

This repository contains all the code, data, results, and documentation for the Master's Thesis titled:

**"Estimating Flexibility Potential of Residential EV Charging in an Urban Community using Cost Optimization"**

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This study focuses on evaluating how flexible electric vehicle (EV) charging can help reduce energy costs and support the power grid. Using real-world mobility, solar, and demand data, a cost optimization model is developed with Pyomo to analyze smart charging strategies for residential EVs.
